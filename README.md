# TDHCA Portal Application

This project is an Angular-based web application for the TDHCA portal.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version `^18.19.0` or `^20.9.0` or higher.
- **npm**: Version `10.x` or higher (comes bundled with Node.js).
- **Git**: For cloning and managing the source code.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhargav12155/tdhca.git

```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the necessary packages and libraries required by the project. This might take a few minutes.

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server with the following command:

```bash
npx ng serve
```

This command will compile the application and start a server. By default, it will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

### 5. Open in Browser
